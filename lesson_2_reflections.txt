What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing an empty repository needs to be done in order to identify a 
directory as a git repo and enabling git functionality. Initializing creates 
the metadata folder for git and enables git commands and version control to be
used with the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different as files in the staging area are not yet
committed to the repository, but they are being prepared to be committed unlike
the working directory. This is valuable as it allows you to only commit what
you want to commit at any given time, rather than the whole package.
